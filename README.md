## Purpose

This project is a part of my education for Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp. As a
class, we were tasked to refactor starter code for a web page for a fictional company. I appreciate
the experience that I gained by accomplishing this task.

## Technologies Used

This project was completed using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/about), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Git Hub](https://github.com/).

## Improvements made

There were many improvements made to the starter code that are documented below. A screenshot of the 
web page is displayed below:

### HTML Elements

The Horiseon webpage is the front page for a search engine optimization company, something
that they're able to do with their now functional website.
In order to live up to its namesake, Horiseon's page needed to have its HTML elements optimized:
* The page was given a descriptive title
* Semantic HTML elements were used
* The page's anchor links were fixed. Screenshots of where the links lead to on the page are as 
follows:

### CSS Elements

As we know, a webpage is only presentable when it has its cascading style sheet(s) in sync with its
HTML elements. Horiseon's CSS sheet was also optimized with the following changes:
* IDs and Classes were given to elements for the CSS sheet to more efficiently grant them style
* Redundant CSS elements were consolidated for a cleaner code
* Redundant or ineffective commands were deleted
* Extensive documentation about the function of the code was attached to each command
